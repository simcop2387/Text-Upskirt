=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Upskirt qw/markdown smartypants/;
    
    my $markdown = << 'EOMD';
    Installation
    ============

    The simplest way to install this is with cpanm!
    Thanks to 'Natacha Porté' for Upskirt.
    EOMD
    
    my $html = markdown($markdown);
    my $fancyhtml = smartypants($html);

At this point $html contains the basic html rendered from the markdown, which will look like

    <h1>Installation</h1>
    
    <p>The simplest way to install this is with cpanm!
    Thanks to 'Natacha Porté' and any other contributors for Upskirt</p>

and $fancyhtml has had smart quotes and things added to look like this

    <h1>Installation</h1>
    
    <p>The simplest way to install this is with cpanm!
    Thanks to &lsquo;Natacha Porté&rsquo; and any other contributors for Upskirt</p>

=head1 Functions

=over 8

=item C<MKDEXT_AUTOLINK>

Automatically create links from urls and email addresses.

NOTES:
    If you plan on using C<smartypants> you may encounter issues if you attempt to use the ``fancy'' quote style exhibited there.

=item C<MKDEXT_LAX_HTML_BLOCKS>

Allow HTML tags inside paragraphs without being surrounded by newlines.

=item C<MKDEXT_NO_INTRA_EMPHASIS>

Avoid turning text like C<my_awesome_function> into C<E<lt>emE<gt>awesomeE<lt>/emE<gt>function>.  You will need to escape phrases as C<I like it when you say, "_I love you_.">

=item C<MKDEXT_SPACE_HEADERS>

Force a space between header hashes and the header itself

=item C<MKDEXT_STRIKETHROUGH>

Let you make strikethroughs by surrounding text with ~~.

=item C<MKDEXT_TABLES>

Let you create tables similar to the PHP Markdown Extra
